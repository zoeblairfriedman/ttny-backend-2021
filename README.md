# ArtGlobe

## Inspiration
Our mission was to help users tap into NYC's vibrant art scene with a single, personalized recommendation based on their day's preferences, circumstances, vibes, and budget. Inspired by the Magic 8-Balls of our youth——shake the snow globe! You never know what piece of art, theatre, music, cinema, architecture or design you're going to get. 

## What it does
The homepage is a stunning, interactive, snowglobe cityscape. Answer the short questionnaire and ArtGlobe's algorithm will search our curated database for a personalized recommendation, delivered to you complete with url. 

## How we built it
The frontend is entirely CSS, HTML, and JavaScript! The backend API was built with Ruby on Rails over a PostgreSQL database. 

## Our team
Danielle, Brooke met first, having previously hacked together. First time hacker, Zoe, joined the party next and helped conceptualize. Danielle created stunning figma designs, while Brooke brought the incredible snow globe and additional design to life. Maxine joined on day 2! Zoe built the backend API and made a first pass at the forms and algorithm, but Maxine swoooped in, saved the day and got the questionairre over the finish line! 

## Challenges we ran into
Separations of concerns between the frontend and backend took a bit of trial and error. We wasted a lot of time figuring out what exactly needed to live where. For some reason this author found herself determined to make a fetch request to extract
