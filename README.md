# ArtGlobe
ArtGlobe was created for TechTogether New York's 2021 Hackaton by Brooke Rahn, Danielle Tulchinsky, Zoe Friedman, and 
Maxine Meurer

## Inspiration
The mission was to help users tap into NYC's vibrant art scene with a single, personalized recommendation based on their day's preferences, circumstances, vibes, and budget. With the body of a souvenier snow globe and the spirit of a Magic 8 Ball——give it a shake! You never know what piece of art, theatre, music, cinema, architecture or design you're going to get. 

## What it does
The homepage is a stunning, interactive, snowglobe cityscape. Answer the short questionnaire and ArtGlobe's algorithm will search our curated database for a personalized recommendation, delivered to you complete with url. 

## How we built it
The frontend is entirely CSS, HTML, and JavaScript! The backend API was built with Ruby on Rails over a PostgreSQL database. 

## Our team
Danielle and Brooke teamed up first, having previously hacked together. First time hacker, Zoe, joined the party next and helped conceptualize. Danielle created stunning figma designs, while Brooke brought the incredible snow globe and additional design to life. First time hacker, Maxine, joined on day 2! Zoe built the backend API and made a first pass at the forms and algorithms, but Maxine swoooped in, saved the day and got the questionairre up and running! The quiz logic and styling were all still being tweaked down til the final hour! 

## Challenges we ran into

From Zoe: My first big challenge was figuring out the separations of concerns between the front and back end! Knowing I was going to be working with others, this needed to be really clear and we had to decide quickly! So a little more thoughtful planning as to what my actual routes were going to be when I made my fetch requests——— this would have saved me some time farther down the line. All of a sudden I was writing a fetch request that didn't make any sense at all! I've also never worked like this with other people on the same code. And on such a time crunch? And I can't see what they're doing? It's hard to all work on the same project when you can't always have eyes on the other people's work. I found working this way remotely to be really challenging! For me working with others through get was a big learning curve. I know it's important and I've been a bit timid until now. This was quite a crash course. Also bugs—bugs for days. Thank you stackoverflow and my amazing teammates!

From Brooke: My biggest challenge was trying to figure out how to translate the designs on Figma into HTML and CSS. Even though Figma has CSS values for our designs, they didn't fit the screen size the application was built for so I had to learn how to resize everything or work around it. Due to time constraints, I wasn't able to code out the text in a wavy pattern like our prototype. I figured out how to animate the letters, but getting them to statically form a wave turned out to be really challenging.

Zoe speaking for Maxine who is furiously coding away: Maxine came late to the group and had to be brought up to speed on other people's work really quickly! This was due to the last minute loss of her previous team. While a helpful framework (like React!) might have made it all a bit easier/faster to build, creating this all in vanilla JavaScript provided an additional layer to the challenge. Also, Maxine has a young child at home, and took this all on while seeing to the needs of her family as well! The quiz logic was super challenging and she really busted her butt figuring it out. And the database she was working with while she was figuring it out before the backend went live was very small, which was a challenge. She also had a bunch of github noobs on her team and was on a huge time crunch to get the quiz inside of a modal. As of the writing of the read me our modal is moving with our train——good luck, Maxine! 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

"Getting the button to sit over the snowglobe! It seems like the smallest thing, but it took me a while to figure out how to layer the divs so everything was where I needed it to be." 

"I am also very proud of my animations: the shaking globe, moving train and falling snow! It was really fun to animate the page."

"This is going to sound crazy, but my proudest moment was submitting a pull request this morning that was a change to someone else's code! Working with other people in git scares the hell out of me and I finally feel like it's starting to make sense." 

"I'm proud that I was the 'Backend Engineer' on this project! I spend so much time in React these days, it was really cool to contribute an API that was all a love letter to my city!"
